   945) Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
   946) now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
   947) laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
   948) the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
   949) the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
   950) Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the

  1001) How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
  1002) Nay, very pale.

  1028) Season your admiration for awhile
  1029) As to expend your time with us awhile,
  1030) Absent thee from felicity awhile,

  1037) That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
  1038) Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple

  1062) To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
  1063) Can you advise me?
  1064) Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  1065) My lord, you once did love me.
  1066) you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
  1067) What do you think of me?
  1068) I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  1069) What are they that would speak with me?
  1070) I pray you, go with me.
  1071) To punish me with this and this with me,
  1072) charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
  1073) Mark me.
  1074) It well appears: but tell me
  1075) Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
  1076) Who is't that can inform me?
  1077) Nor thine on me.
  1078) And, to the last, bended their light on me.

  1087) That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
  1088) Speak to me:
  1089) Speak to me:
  1090) Of his affection to me.
  1091) Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me

  1095) Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
  1096) What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
  1097) King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
  1098) Come, one for me.
  1099) Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
  1100) Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
  1101) She well instructs me.
  1102) By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
  1103) And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
  1104) With all my heart; and it doth much content me
  1105) Have you forgot me?
  1106) Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
  1107) To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
  1108) In noise so rude against me?
  1109) How all occasions do inform against me,
  1110) But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
  1111) Will you be ruled by me?

  1118) By cock, they are to blame.
  1119) I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
  1120) O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
  1121) That hath in it no profit but the name.
  1122) That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
  1123) Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
  1124) The very same.
  1125) To reason most absurd: whose common theme
  1126) Why I will fight with him upon this theme
  1127) O my son, what theme?
  1128) Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
  1129) So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  1130) For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
  1131) Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
  1132) My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
  1133) play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
  1134) Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
  1135) If his chief good and market of his time
  1136) You must not take for fire. From this time
  1137) To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
  1138) But that I know love is begun by time;
  1139) In happy time.
  1140) All in the morning betime,
  1141) To any pastime?
  1142) Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
  1143) Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
  1144) the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
  1145) I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
  1146) pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
  1147) your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
  1148) There with fantastic garlands did she come
  1149) I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
  1150) To let this canker of our nature come
  1151) He will stay till ye come.
  1152) For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
  1153) I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
  1154) That if again this apparition come,
  1155) Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  1156) Have after. To what issue will this come?
  1157) My hour is almost come,
  1158) Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
  1159) For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
  1160) O, here they come.
  1161) You are welcome.
  1162) And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
  1163) Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
  1164) Most welcome home!
  1165) Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
  1166) To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
  1167) In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
  1168) When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
  1169) I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
  1170) Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
  1171) And liegemen to the Dane.
  1172) You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
  1173) Hamlet the Dane.
  1174) Have by the very cunning of the scene
  1175) Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
  1176) the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
  1177) Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
  1178) And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
  1179) Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
  1180) Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
  1181) 'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
  1182) I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
  1183) I made to her in marriage, and to decline
  1184) To those of mine!
  1185) And I do think, or else this brain of mine
  1186) I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
  1187) It will be short: the interim is mine;
  1188) yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
  1189) The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
  1190) are not mine.
  1191) To be your Valentine.
  1192) Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
  1193) Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
  1194) One.
  1195) Then is the world one.
  1196) The bell then beating one,--
  1197) From another one?
  1198) that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
  1199) To you yourself, to us, to every one.
  1200) And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
  1201) I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
  1202) Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
  1203) No more be done:
  1204) Must there no more be done?
  1205) Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
  1206) If there be any good thing to be done,
  1207) With sore distraction. What I have done,
  1208) Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
  1209) And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
  1210) O me, what hast thou done?
  1211) Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
  1212) the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
  1213) He is dead and gone;
  1214) Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
  1215) Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
  1216) He is gone, he is gone,
  1217) 'Tis gone!
  1218) Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
  1219) Now I am alone.
  1220) Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
  1221) To you alone.
  1222) For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
  1223) And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
  1224) Why, he had none.
  1225) I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
  1226) You are the most immediate to our throne;
  1227) At his heels a stone.
  1228) Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
  1229) Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
  1230) On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
  1231) my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
  1232) The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
  1233) I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
  1234) For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
  1235) That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
  1236) Nor the soles of her shoe?
  1237) From top to toe?
  1238) O, treble woe
  1239) These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  1240) To be contracted in one brow of woe,
  1241) Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
  1242) Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
  1243) I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
  1244) Thou comest in such a questionable shape
  1245) this pipe?
  1246) To business with the king, more than the scope
  1247) An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
  1248) To desperation turn my trust and hope!
  1249) For the supply and profit of our hope,
  1250) Could not so mope.
  1251) that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
  1252) thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
  1253) My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
  1254) What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
  1255) To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
  1256) Half a share.
  1257) Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
  1258) Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
  1259) Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
  1260) But to my mind, though I am native here
  1261) Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
  1262) Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
  1263) And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
  1264) Is it not monstrous that this player here,
  1265) odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
  1266) Peace! who comes here?
  1267) 'Tis here!
  1268) 'Tis here!
  1269) Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
  1270) Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
  1271) That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
  1272) That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
  1273) That youth and observation copied there;
  1274) modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
  1275) Our purpose may hold there.
  1276) Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
  1277) Do you see nothing there?
  1278) Go seek him there.
  1279) I would I had been there.
  1280) It had been so with us, had we been there:
  1281) What, is Horatio there?
  1282) there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
  1283) Who's there?
  1284) I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
  1285) O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
  1286) What is the issue of the business there.
  1287) Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
  1288) Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
  1289) At supper! where?
  1290) Drown'd! O, where?
  1291) To England send him, or confine him where
  1292) how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
  1293) Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
  1294) To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
  1295) Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
  1296) 'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
  1297) What, frighted with false fire!
  1298) And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
  1299) As if it some impartment did desire
  1300) For every man has business and desire,
  1301) Out of the shot and danger of desire.
  1302) It is most retrograde to our desire:
  1303) Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
  1304) Before you visit him, to make inquire
  1305) O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
  1306) I'll be with you straight go a little before.
  1307) And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
  1308) Never departed more.
  1309) him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  1310) To keep itself from noyance; but much more
  1311) And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
  1312) No more!
  1313) Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
  1314) tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
  1315) The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
  1316) 'One fair daughter and no more,
  1317) O, speak to me no more;
  1318) O Hamlet, speak no more:
  1319) Think it no more;
  1320) And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
  1321) Makes vow before his uncle never more
  1322) But what is your affair in Elsinore?
  1323) welcome to Elsinore.
  1324) beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
  1325) Within the centre.
  1326) The terms of our estate may not endure
  1327) And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
  1328) You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  1329) Well may it sort that this portentous figure
  1330) Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
  1331) Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  1332) Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
  1333) Have you so slander any moment leisure,
  1334) Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  1335) mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
  1336) For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
  1337) Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
  1338) Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
  1339) Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
  1340) I am satisfied in nature,
  1341) So crimeful and so capital in nature,
  1342) That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
  1343) A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
  1344) A violet in the youth of primy nature,
  1345) Among a mineral of metals base,
  1346) Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
  1347) We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
  1348) But, like the owner of a foul disease,
  1349) They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
  1350) Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  1351) Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
  1352) Good sir, whose powers are these?
  1353) Last, and as much containing as all these,
  1354) Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
  1355) Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
  1356) For food and diet, to some enterprise

  1358) But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
  1359) A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise

  1362) When it proved otherwise?
  1363) Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
  1364) As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
  1365) O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
  1366) As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
  1367) O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?

  1423) As it doth well appear unto our state--
  1424) Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
  1425) The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
  1426) As of a father: for let the world take note,
  1427) As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
  1428) Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
  1429) The effect of what I wrote?

  1432) Bid the players make haste.
  1433) Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste

  1435) we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
  1436) For the demand of our neglected tribute
  1437) The pith and marrow of our attribute.
  1438) Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  1439) Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  1440) See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
  1441) Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
  1442) Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
  1443) What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue

  1452) 'Tis most true:

  1479) Into my grave.

  1514) As woman's love.
  1515) Received his love?
  1516) Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away.

  1557) If it be made of penetrable stuff,
  1558) do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
  1559) Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if

  1578) With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
  1579) As thou art to thyself:

  1581) purpose, confess thyself--
  1582) Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
  1583) Must render up myself.
  1584) How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,

  1591) the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of

  1593) But these cannot I command to any utterance of
  1594) I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of

  1596) Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of

  1598) know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
  1599) dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
  1600) Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
  1601) It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
  1602) so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
  1603) plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
  1604) verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
  1605) sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of

  1623) see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,

  1626) Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
  1627) Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching
  1628) the body. The king is a thing--
  1629) More relative than this: the play 's the thing
  1630) me one thing.
  1631) Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  1632) And then it started like a guilty thing
  1633) Nothing.

  1644) They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
  1645) Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
  1646) Is it not like the king?
  1647) There is a play to-night before the king;
  1648) Long live the king!
  1649) How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
  1650) Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
  1651) Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
  1652) An earnest conjuration from the king,
  1653) To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
  1654) this, give these fellows some means to the king:
  1655) with us to the king.
  1656) This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
  1657) prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
  1658) But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
  1659) did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
  1660) Is it the king?
  1661) I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
  1662) Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
  1663) Player King
  1664) Player King
  1665) Player King
  1666) Player King
  1667) 'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
  1668) Both to my God and to my gracious king:
  1669) At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
  1670) I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
  1671) Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
  1672) sings at grave-making?
  1673) This man shall set me packing:
  1674) That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
  1675) me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
  1676) Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
  1677) in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
  1678) When thou liest howling.
  1679) In censure of his seeming.
  1680) Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
  1681) Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  1682) Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
  1683) mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
  1684) His silence will sit drooping.
  1685) after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
  1686) A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
  1687) Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  1688) The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
  1689) Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
  1690) The canker galls the infants of the spring,
  1691) Not a mouse stirring.
  1692) Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
  1693) Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
  1694) Writing
  1695) A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
  1696) Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
  1697) And sure I am two men there are not living
  1698) Most generous and free from all contriving,
  1699) When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
  1700) differences, of very soft society and great showing:
  1701) Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following
  1702) If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
  1703) Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
  1704) could see the puppets dallying.
  1705) This is too long.
  1706) The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
  1707) Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  1708) Therefore I have entreated him along
  1709) Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
  1710) Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  1711) Believe so much in him, that he is young
  1712) My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
  1713) comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
  1714) withers are unwrung.
  1715) But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  1716) In going back to school in Wittenberg,
  1717) I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
  1718) Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
  1719) And smelt so? pah!
  1720) grave's this, sirrah?
  1721) And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
  1722) And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
  1723) Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
  1724) of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
  1725) Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
  1726) study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
  1727) My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
  1728) I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
  1729) I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
  1730) If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  1731) Craves the conveyance of a promised march
  1732) Appears before them, and with solemn march
  1733) And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
  1734) To cut his throat i' the church.
  1735) Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
  1736) I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  1737) Follow her close; give her good watch,
  1738) And I with them the third night kept the watch;
  1739) Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
  1740) With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  1741) Why this same strict and most observant watch
  1742) Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
  1743) A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
  1744) You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
  1745) digested in the scenes, set down with as much
  1746) The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
  1747) Without the sensible and true avouch
  1748) inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
  1749) As if I had never been such.
  1750) And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
  1751) set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
  1752) The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
  1753) marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
  1754) That swift as quicksilver it courses through
  1755) For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
  1756) Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
  1757) And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
  1758) As love between them like the palm might flourish,
  1759) And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
  1760) Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
  1761) We'll put the matter to the present push.
  1762) Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
  1763) This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
  1764) It may be death.
  1765) Under the moon, can save the thing from death
  1766) He should the bearers put to sudden death,
  1767) Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
  1768) For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
  1769) But that the dread of something after death,
  1770) He never gave commandment for their death.
  1771) That I am guiltless of your father's death,
  1772) With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
  1773) Which I have told thee of my father's death:
  1774) Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
  1775) Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
  1776) O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
  1777) Gives me superfluous death.
  1778) To muddy death.

  2355) Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
  2356) It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
  2357) I doubt it is no other but the main;
  2358) And we beseech you, bend you to remain
  2359) And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
  2360) This the very coinage of your brain:

  2374) O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  2375) And never come mischance between us twain!
  2376) Up from my cabin,
  2377) To his confine: and of the truth herein
  2378) 'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
  2379) Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
  2380) And, as the world were now but to begin,
  2381) I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
  2382) Since nature cannot choose his origin--
  2383) A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
  2384) Noise within
  2385) A noise within
  2386) Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within

  2388) Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
  2389) Flourish of trumpets within
  2390) March afar off, and shot within
  2391) yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
  2392) Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  2393) And after we will both our judgments join
  2394) Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
  2395) Our son shall win.
  2396) Such was the very armour he had on
  2397) I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

  2405) Go softly on.
  2406) And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  2407) And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
  2408) In honourable fashion.
  2409) come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
  2410) A scullion!
  2411) But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
  2412) To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  2413) Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
  2414) But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
  2415) Into a towering passion.
  2416) Had he the motive and the cue for passion
  2417) exclaim against their own succession?
  2418) When we would bring him on to some confession
  2419) they hold up Adam's profession.
  2420) Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
  2421) I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!

  2424) And gem of all the nation.
  2425) If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
  2426) He waxes desperate with imagination.
  2427) I have in quick determination
  2428) To show my duty in your coronation,
  2429) I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
  2430) The very place puts toys of desperation,
  2431) into amazement and admiration.
  2432) Do not forget: this visitation
  2433) No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
  2434) And they in France of the best rank and station
  2435) I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
  2436) wilfully seeks her own salvation?
  2437) late innovation.
  2438) Look, with what courteous action
  2439) Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
  2440) And keep you in the rear of your affection,
  2441) And could of men distinguish, her election
  2442) good discretion.
  2443) Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
  2444) that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
  2445) According to the phrase or the addition
  2446) Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  2447) Why should we in our peevish opposition
  2448) So horridly to shake our disposition
  2449) But with much forcing of his disposition.
  2450) That might your nature, honour and exception
  2451) Shall in the general censure take corruption
  2452) cuffs in the question.
  2453) To be, or not to be: that is the question:
  2454) By this encompassment and drift of question
  2455) That I must call't in question.
  2456) But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
  2457) And thus the native hue of resolution

  2459) By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
  2460) afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
  2461) For what we know must be and is as common
  2462) Ay, madam, it is common.
  2463) And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
  2464) And his sandal shoon.
  2465) So many journeys may the sun and moon
  2466) Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
  2467) If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
  2468) My custom always of the afternoon,
  2469) 'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
  2470) What's his weapon?
  2471) Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
  2472) Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
  2473) I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
  2474) Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
  2475) Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  2476) Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
  2477) Where is your son?
  2478) Than that which dearest father bears his son,
  2479) But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
  2480) You laying these slight sullies on my son,
  2481) That capability and god-like reason
  2482) O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
  2483) Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
  2484) Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
  2485) Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
  2486) What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
  2487) to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
  2488) Treason! treason!
  2489) Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
  2490) Denmark's a prison.
  2491) it is a prison.
  2492) Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:

  3671) Then came each actor on his ass,--
  3672) might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
  3673) You go not till I set you up a glass
  3674) Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
  3675) That it might please you to give quiet pass
  3676) A touch, a touch, I do confess.
  3677) So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
  3678) Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
  3679) Without debatement further, more or less,
  3680) This is mere madness:
  3681) Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
  3682) And I the matter will re-word; which madness
  3683) That I essentially am not in madness,
  3684) Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
  3685) And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
  3686) How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
  3687) And that shall lend a kind of easiness
  3688) Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  3689) Answer, and think upon this business.
  3690) shall be the end of my business.
  3691) She turns to favour and to prettiness.

  3696) Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
  3697) As one incapable of her own distress,
  3698) Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
  3699) Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
  3700) And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
  3701) Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
  3702) Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
  3703) Why you proceeded not against these feats,
  3704) Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
  3705) Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
  3706) With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
  3707) Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
  3708) Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
  3709) lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
  3710) With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
  3711) Lights, lights, lights!
  3712) But I do prophesy the election lights
  3713) And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  3714) And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
  3715) love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
  3716) Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
  3717) My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  3718) if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
  3719) That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
  3720) As he is very potent with such spirits,
  3721) But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
  3722) But mere implorators of unholy suits,
  3723) O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
  3724) Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  3725) Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
  3726) Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,

  3733) thousand tenants.
  3734) Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
  3735) As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
  3736) Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
  3737) That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
  3738) And even the like precurse of fierce events,
  3739) Between the pass and fell incensed points
  3740) And there I see such black and grained spots
  3741) Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts

  3745) out of his swaddling-clouts.

  3753) Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
  3754) When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
  3755) you any further trade with us?
  3756) I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
  3757) If that his majesty would aught with us,
  3758) I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
  3759) For your desire to know what is between us,
  3760) Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
  3761) Be you content to lend your patience to us,
  3762) With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
  3763) it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--

  4041) And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
  4042) This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

  4057) but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
  4058) What think you on't?
  4059) From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

  4061) I will do't:
  4062) To't.

  4064) So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  4065) Nay, but swear't.

  4077) Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
  4078) Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;

  4080) Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
  4081) was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
  4082) As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
  4083) [To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
  4084) Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
  4085) E'en that.
  4086) Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
  4087) And for my soul, what can it do to that,
  4088) A villain kills my father; and for that,
  4089) How now! what noise is that?
  4090) Do you doubt that?
  4091) I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
  4092) As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
  4093) I would know that.
  4094) Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
  4095) I must to England; you know that?
  4096) Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that

  4098) Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
  4099) To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
  4100) easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
  4101) Believe what?
  4102) Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
  4103) Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  4104) I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
  4105) Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
  4106) To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
  4107) Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
  4108) Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
  4109) Is thought-sick at the act.
  4110) At gaming, swearing, or about some act
  4111) Such an act
  4112) Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
  4113) That are but mutes or audience to this act,
  4114) But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
  4115) Ay me, what act,
  4116) What did you enact?
  4117) Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
  4118) She is importunate, indeed distract:
  4119) Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
  4120) Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  4121) The leperous distilment; whose effect
  4122) That we find out the cause of this effect,
  4123) By letters congruing to that effect,
  4124) 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
  4125) Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
  4126) Must give us pause: there's the respect
  4127) As will not leave their tinct.
  4128) liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
  4129) To lay our service freely at your feet,

  4131) For and a shrouding sheet:
  4132) O, methought, there was nothing meet.
  4133) As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
  4134) For such a guest is meet.
  4135) For such a guest is meet.
  4136) When in one line two crafts directly meet.
  4137) And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
  4138) Methought it was very sweet,
  4139) the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
  4140) Most necessary 'tis that we forget
  4141) Good my lord, be quiet.
  4142) Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
  4143) And put it in his pocket!

  4519) How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  4520) So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  4521) As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
  4522) I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
  4523) Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
  4524) That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
  4525) Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
  4526) This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
  4527) Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
  4528) Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
  4529) How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  4530) What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
  4531) No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
  4532) Enter HAMLET
  4533) Enter HAMLET
  4534) Enter HAMLET
  4535) Enter HAMLET
  4536) Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
  4537) What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  4538) Ghost beckons HAMLET
  4539) No more, sweet Hamlet!
  4540) Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
  4541) Exeunt all except HAMLET
  4542) Exeunt all but HAMLET
  4543) Exeunt all but HAMLET
  4544) Exeunt all but HAMLET

  4546) But you'll be secret?
  4547) Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
  4548) SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.
  4549) My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
  4550) My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
  4551) And with a sudden vigour doth posset
  4552) though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
  4553) hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
  4554) And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
  4555) And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
  4556) Here's yet some liquor left.
  4557) Marry, sir, here's my drift;
  4558) Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  4559) From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
  4560) By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
  4561) That lend a tyrannous and damned light
  4562) Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
  4563) This must be known; which, being kept close, might
  4564) sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
  4565) savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
  4566) could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
  4567) Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
  4568) Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
  4569) With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
  4570) Well, good night.
  4571) The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
  4572) good night, good night.
  4573) Give you good night.
  4574) Give you good night.
  4575) In the dead vast and middle of the night,
  4576) Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
  4577) Tis now the very witching time of night,
  4578) What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
  4579) With us to watch the minutes of this night;
  4580) Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
  4581) Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
  4582) Hold you the watch to-night?
  4583) I will watch to-night;
  4584) Let us impart what we have seen to-night
  4585) Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  4586) Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
  4587) What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  4588) That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
  4589) And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
  4590) shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
  4591) My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  4592) Why, right; you are i' the right;
  4593) Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
  4594) It falls right.
  4595) That ever I was born to set it right!
  4596) Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
  4597) Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
  4598) And vanish'd from our sight.
  4599) If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
  4600) Where is this sight?
  4601) Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  4602) And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
  4603) I never gave you aught.
  4604) Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
  4605) But in our circumstance and course of thought,
  4606) Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
  4607) With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
  4608) Marry, well bethought:
  4609) But answer made it none: yet once methought
  4610) Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
  4611) a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
  4612) that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
  4613) it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
  4614) Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
  4615) a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
  4616) He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
  4617) out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
  4618) three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
  4619) Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  4620) My lord, I did intend it.
  4621) So be it!
  4622) So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
  4623) A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
  4624) It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
  4625) Never believe it:
  4626) Do not believe it.
  4627) So have I heard and do in part believe it.
  4628) Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
  4629) And draw you into madness? think of it:
  4630) O, throw away the worser part of it,
  4631) i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
  4632) To let you know of it.
  4633) And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  4634) And will not wrong it.
  4635) Than your particular demands will touch it:
  4636) Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
  4637) But do not go with it.
  4638) It beckons you to go away with it,
  4639) you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
  4640) How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
  4641) No; you'll reveal it.
  4642) Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
  4643) against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
  4644) for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
  4645) Good my lord, tell it.
  4646) To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
  4647) So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
  4648) He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  4649) Did you not speak to it?
  4650) But truly, I do fear it.
  4651) Let us haste to hear it,
  4652) And am most sensible in grief for it,
  4653) Whose was it?
  4654) straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
  4655) Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
  4656) too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
  4657) Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
  4658) But that this folly douts it.
  4659) The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
  4660) but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
  4661) Heaven will direct it.
  4662) It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
  4663) It will not speak; then I will follow it.
  4664) We will try it.
  4665) and of very liberal conceit.
  4666) Could force his soul so to his own conceit
  4667) fit.
  4668) Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
  4669) We would not understand what was most fit;
  4670) And, sister, as the winds give benefit
  4671) If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
  4672) A hit, a very palpable hit.
  4673) Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
  4674) Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
  4675) I am thy father's spirit,
  4676) The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
  4677) Thus much the business is: we have here writ
  4678) And I beseech you instantly to visit
  4679) And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:

  4704) Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
  4705) So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
  4706) Of general assault.
