  1062) Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
  1063) 'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
  1064) I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
  1065) I made to her in marriage, and to decline

  1067) And I do think, or else this brain of mine
  1068) I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
  1069) It will be short: the interim is mine;
  1070) yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.

  1086) If there be any good thing to be done,
  1087) With sore distraction. What I have done,
  1088) Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

  1097) Now I am alone.
  1098) Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone

  1102) Why, he had none.
  1103) I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
  1104) You are the most immediate to our throne;
  1105) At his heels a stone.

  1114) Nor the soles of her shoe?
  1115) From top to toe?

  1118) To be contracted in one brow of woe,
  1119) Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
  1120) I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
  1121) Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
  1122) this pipe?
  1123) To business with the king, more than the scope
  1124) An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!

  1127) Could not so mope.
  1128) that old men have grey beards, that their faces are

  1130) My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
  1131) What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
  1132) To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
  1133) Half a share.
  1134) Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
  1135) Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
  1136) Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
  1137) But to my mind, though I am native here
  1138) Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
  1139) Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
  1140) And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
  1141) Is it not monstrous that this player here,

  1146) Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
  1147) Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
  1148) That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
  1149) That youth and observation copied there;
  1150) modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
  1151) Our purpose may hold there.

  1153) Do you see nothing there?
  1154) Go seek him there.
  1155) I would I had been there.
  1156) It had been so with us, had we been there:
  1157) What, is Horatio there?
  1158) there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
  1159) O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!

  1170) To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
  1171) Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
  1172) What, frighted with false fire!
  1173) And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:

  1175) For every man has business and desire,
  1176) Out of the shot and danger of desire.
  1177) It is most retrograde to our desire:

  1184) him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  1185) To keep itself from noyance; but much more
  1186) And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
  1187) 'One fair daughter and no more,
  1188) O, speak to me no more;
  1189) The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
  1190) O Hamlet, speak no more:
  1191) Think it no more;
  1192) tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
  1193) No more!
  1194) Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
  1195) And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
  1196) Makes vow before his uncle never more
  1197) But what is your affair in Elsinore?
  1198) welcome to Elsinore.
  1199) beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
  1200) Within the centre.

  1204) Well may it sort that this portentous figure
  1205) Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
  1206) Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

  1208) Have you so slander any moment leisure,
  1209) Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  1210) mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
  1211) For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
  1212) Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
  1213) Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
  1214) Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
  1215) I am satisfied in nature,
  1216) So crimeful and so capital in nature,
  1217) That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
  1218) A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
  1219) A violet in the youth of primy nature,
  1220) Among a mineral of metals base,
  1221) Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
  1222) We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
  1223) But, like the owner of a foul disease,
  1224) They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
  1225) Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  1226) Last, and as much containing as all these,
  1227) Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
  1228) Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
  1229) For food and diet, to some enterprise
  1230) Through your dominions for this enterprise,
  1231) But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
  1232) A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
  1233) Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
  1234) For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
  1235) When it proved otherwise?
  1236) Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
  1237) As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
  1238) O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
  1239) As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
  1240) As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
  1241) Or but a sickly part of one true sense
  1242) As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
  1243) the daintier sense.
  1244) Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
  1245) Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
  1246) Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those

  1249) The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
  1250) And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
  1251) Or with a little shuffling, you may choose

  1261) Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
  1262) I had my father's signet in my purse,
  1263) Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
  1264) Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
  1265) For this effect defective comes by cause:
  1266) Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
  1267) That your good beauties be the happy cause
  1268) Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
  1269) That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,

  1289) As it doth well appear unto our state--
  1290) Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
  1291) The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
  1292) As of a father: for let the world take note,
  1293) As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
  1294) Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
  1295) The effect of what I wrote?
  1296) The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
  1297) Bid the players make haste.

  1313) 'Tis most true:
  1314) Collected from all simples that have virtue
  1315) To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
  1316) Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

  3329) Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
  3330) is a strumpet. What's the news?
  3331) I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
  3332) There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
  3333) This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
  3334) Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
  3335) Cock crows
  3336) Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
  3337) That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
  3338) This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
  3339) As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
  3340) in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  3341) Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
  3342) On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
  3343) Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
  3344) proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
  3345) That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
  3346) Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
  3347) Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
  3348) Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
  3349) We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
  3350) Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
  3351) was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
  3352) As may dishonour him; take heed of that;

  3354) E'en that.
  3355) Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
  3356) And for my soul, what can it do to that,
  3357) A villain kills my father; and for that,
  3358) How now! what noise is that?
  3359) Do you doubt that?
  3360) I would know that.
  3361) I must to England; you know that?
  3362) Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
  3363) What?
  3364) easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
  3365) To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
  3366) Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
  3367) Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  3368) To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:

  3370) Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
  3371) At gaming, swearing, or about some act
  3372) Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
  3373) But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
  3374) What did you enact?
  3375) Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
  3376) She is importunate, indeed distract:
  3377) Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
  3378) The leperous distilment; whose effect
  3379) 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
  3380) Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
  3381) Must give us pause: there's the respect
  3382) As will not leave their tinct.
  3383) To lay our service freely at your feet,
  3384) Lying down at OPHELIA's feet
  3385) For and a shrouding sheet:
  3386) O, methought, there was nothing meet.
  3387) As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
  3388) For such a guest is meet.
  3389) When in one line two crafts directly meet.
  3390) And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
  3391) the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
  3392) Most necessary 'tis that we forget
  3393) And put it in his pocket!
  3394) [Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
  3395) As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

  3615) My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
  3616) hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
  3617) And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
  3618) And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
  3619) Marry, sir, here's my drift;
  3620) From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
  3621) That lend a tyrannous and damned light
  3622) Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
  3623) This must be known; which, being kept close, might
  3624) sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
  3625) savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
  3626) Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
  3627) Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
  3628) With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
  3629) Well, good night.
  3630) good night, good night.
  3631) Give you good night.
  3632) In the dead vast and middle of the night,
  3633) What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
  3634) With us to watch the minutes of this night;
  3635) shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
  3636) Hold you the watch to-night?
  3637) I will watch to-night;
  3638) Let us impart what we have seen to-night
  3639) Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  3640) What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  3641) That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
  3642) And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
  3643) My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  3644) Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
  3645) Why, right; you are i' the right;
  3646) That ever I was born to set it right!
  3647) And vanish'd from our sight.
  3648) If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
  3649) Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  3650) I never gave you aught.
  3651) Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
  3652) But in our circumstance and course of thought,
  3653) Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
  3654) But answer made it none: yet once methought
  3655) out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
  3656) Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  3657) My lord, I did intend it.
  3658) So be it!
  3659) So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
  3660) A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
  3661) It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
  3662) So have I heard and do in part believe it.
  3663) Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
  3664) O, throw away the worser part of it,
  3665) i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
  3666) To let you know of it.
  3667) And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  3668) Than your particular demands will touch it:
  3669) Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
  3670) Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
  3671) So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
  3672) a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
  3673) He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  3674) Did you not speak to it?
  3675) But truly, I do fear it.
  3676) And am most sensible in grief for it,
  3677) Whose was it?
  3678) it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
  3679) too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
  3680) that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
  3681) Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
  3682) But that this folly douts it.
  3683) The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
  3684) Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
  3685) but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
  3686) a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
  3687) And, sister, as the winds give benefit
  3688) Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
  3689) Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
  3690) Thus much the business is: we have here writ
  3691) And I beseech you instantly to visit
  3692) And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
  3693) Exit
  3694) Exit
  3695) Exit
  3696) Exit

  3705) say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
  3706) O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
  3707) It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
  3708) So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
  3709) Of general assault.
  3710) Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
  3711) Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
  3712) Servant
  3713) Exit Servant
  3714) And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
  3715) I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
  3716) Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
  3717) How in my words soever she be shent,
  3718) Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
  3719) A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
  3720) Sir, I lack advancement.
  3721) I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
  3722) Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
  3723) And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
  3724) Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
  3725) But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
  3726) And enterprises of great pith and moment
  3727) Contagious blastments are most imminent.
  3728) Which is not tomb enough and continent
  3729) Yet what can it when one can not repent?
  3730) Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
  3731) Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
  3732) To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
  3733) Against the which, a moiety competent
  3734) My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
  3735) Do I impart toward you. For your intent
  3736) That has no relish of salvation in't;
  3737) That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
  3738) Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
  3739) but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
  3740) What think you on't?
  3741) It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
  3742) Exeunt
  3743) Exeunt
  3744) Exeunt
  3745) Exeunt
  3746) Exeunt
  3747) O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
  3748) No reckoning made, but sent to my account
  3749) Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
  3750) Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot

  4059) Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
  4060) King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
  4061) Thou comest in such a questionable shape
  4062) Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
  4063) Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
  4064) Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
  4065) Angels and ministers of grace defend us!

  4146) MARCELLUS
  4147) HAMLET
  4148) How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
  4149) No; you'll reveal it.
  4150) Good my lord, tell it.
  4151) I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
  4152) You, as your business and desire shall point you;
  4153) So, gentlemen,
  4154) about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
  4155) Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
  4156) That he is open to incontinency;
  4157) That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly

Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

  4776) They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
  4777) And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
  4778) Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
  4779) Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,

  4913) her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
  4914) borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
  4915) Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow

  4935) LAERTES
  4936) HAMLET
  4937) First Priest
  4938) I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
  4939) Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
  4940) Of blue Olympus.
  4941) HAMLET
  4942) Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
  4943) Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  4944) And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
  4945) So bloodily hast struck?
  4946) Gertrude, do not drink.
  4947) And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
  4948) My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
  4949) Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  4950) Then, venom, to thy work.
  4951) Which was the model of that Danish seal;
  4952) My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
  4953) Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
  4954) I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  4955) The sight is dismal;

  5005) They had begun the play--I sat me down,
  5006) The king and queen and all are coming down.
  5007) I once did hold it, as our statists do,
  5008) 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
